The playbook gather snmp-facts from a Cico router and print interfaces to file.
As fact modules are not available for SR-OS the CLI are used to gather router interfaces and print result to file.
Results are formattet to json.
I have spent som time trying to extract interesting information and make pretty prints, but are somehow stucket of using the playbook in that sense.
